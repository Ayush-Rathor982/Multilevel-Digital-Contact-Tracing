Title: Multilevel Digital Contact Tracing, G. Mahapatra, P. Pradhan, A. Khan, S. K. Setua, R. K. Pal, A. Rathor, R. Chattaraj, S. Banerjee.


The code segment generates and trace infected chain and seperates it from main contact network of large synthetic data sets

===============================================================================================================================
                                                                   START
===============================================================================================================================

code files:-
dataGenerate.h
GenerateInfectedList.h
contact_trace.cpp
infection pathways display file for the visualization (optional in python) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notations:-
N - Population size (Input from the keyboard)
L - 3 (default), number of levels tracing
q - average degree of the contact graph (Input from the keyboard)
D - 10 days (default) incubation period (Input from the keyboard)
I - 1 or 2 (default) set of infedted persons randomly selected from the population

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Input' folder contains two folder :

1. GeneratedData : contains the files like 'day6.txt' which stores the contacts between persons, which is generated by random distribution 
2. Infected_List : contains the files like 'day6.txt' which stores the infected persons list, which is generated by uniform distribution   


Comands to execute programme :-
command to compile the programme  =>  g++ contact_trace.cpp -o contact_trace
command to run the the programme  =>  ./contact_trace 

During executing the programme, It will ask for 
1. Population size, N
2. Average degree, q
3. Incubation period, D 

After entering value of N, q, D, it will generates data for D days (till incubation period, D)

During this it create output folder "Q(value,q)_D(value,D)_N(value,N)" which contains : 

Subfolders :- 
               1. Contact_Graph_info  =>  contains files which stores contacts information for each day 

Files :- 
               1. Data_size_for_population(value,N).txt  =>  stores the count of nodes in list and count of nodes in array for each day and for population, N as:
                                                              (day, N, count of nodes in linked list, count of nodes in array)
               2. Storing_IN_OUT_Data.txt  =>  stores the information how much contacts goes and removed(comes out) into/from array and linked list for each day, as:
                                                (day, number of contacts goes into array, number of contacts removed from array, number of contacts goes into linked list, number of contacts removed from linked list)


Then it will ask for next operation : 
=====================================================
1 => Contact data generation for current day
2 => Contact Tracing for infected persons
3 => Exit from here
Enter your choice:
=====================================================

Case 1.  Choice is 1
  =>     If choice is 1, then it will generates data for next day

Case 2.  Choise is 2
  =>
         If choice is two then first it generates infected list for current day

         After that it stores output/result in folder "Q(value,q)_D(value,D)_N(value,N)",

         Now this folder contains new subfolders and files: 

        files:-
           1. Level_trace_count.txt : It store the information how many persons are traced which have close contacts with infected person(directly and indirectly) on that day,
                                    and also stores count of traced person at each level(level1 => direct contacts, other levels => indirect contacts)
           2. Traced_person_count.txt : It stores the total count of persons traced which have close contact with any of the infected person found on that day 

        subfolders:-
           1. Infected_path_list : contains the files like 'day6.txt' which stores the contacts(directly or indirectly) between infected person with other persons
           2. Level_traverse : contains the files like 'day6.txt' which stores the levelwise traced list of persons which have chances to be infected

Case 3.  Choice is 3
  =>     Exits the programme
